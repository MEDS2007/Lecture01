      Information Architecture has origins in **library science**

      - The development of “**knowledge-organization** systems”
      - Study of how to **categorize**, **catalogue**, **locate** resources

      So it's a kind of cognitive and visual **data structure**

      # IA: **4a**

      Information Architecture uses **Cognitive Psychology** research

      - **Cognitive load**: how much information we can process at any time—avoiding information overload ([rule of 7](http://neuromavin.com/cognitive-limits-social-networks-and-dunbars-number/)).
      - **Mental models**: the assumptions users have—information is easier to discover in familiar places.
      - **Decision making**: the cognitive process of making a choice or selecting an option—IA helps make decisions by providing contextual information at key points.

			## What is Architecture?

			Condensed from Cal Henderson, [Building Scalable Web Sites](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596102357.do) (2006)

			**if buildings were like software**, the architect would be involved in the actual building process, from … foundations … to … fixtures. …starting with a couple of rooms and basic amenities, **people would… start living there before the building was complete**. When the building work was about to finish …more people would turn up and start living there, too.
		</section>
		<section data-markdown class="left-align">
			## Building around users

			…new residents need **new features**. The architect would design these, augmenting the original design. But the **current residents** would **continue using the house** while it was extended, all the time complaining about the building work.

			In fact… **more people would move in** while extensions were being built. When the modifications were complete, the the newcomers would **request more changes**.
		</section>
		<section data-markdown class="left-align">
			## Plan from the start
			
			The key… is **planning for all this from the start**. If thean architect started out by building a huge, complex house, it would be **overkill**. By the time it was ready, the residents **would have gone elsewhere** to live in a smaller house built in a fraction of the time.

			If extending our house (website) takes too long, **people might move elsewhere**. We need start at the right scale and design things to be **extended as easily as possible**.
		</section>
		<section data-markdown class="left-align">
			## Minimize effort

			We're **not going to get anything right first time**. In the [scaling](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/scaling-user-interfaces/ "Scaling User Interfaces: An Information-Processing Approach to Multi-Device Design") of a typical application, **every aspect and feature** is probably going to be **revisited and [refactored](http://www.refactoring.com/ "a change made to the internal structure of software to make it easier to understand and cheaper to modify without changing its observable behavior")**.

			That's fine—the task of an application architect is to **minimize the time it takes to [refactor](https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring "A big site about refactoring") each component**, through **careful initial and ongoing design**.

      # EYE-TRACKING **2**

      **the baby’s face draws attention away from the message**

      This is a problem because the message isn’t commanding attention

      Now see the browsing pattern with baby facing the text:

      # EYE-TRACKING **3**

      users focused on the baby’s face again (from the side) and **followed the baby’s line of sight** to the **headline** and **opening text**.

      Even the area of text that the baby’s chin was pointing to had more attention!

      # DESIGN: **01**

      Four basic principles:

      - **P**roximity
      - **A**lignment
      - **R**epetition
      - **C**ontrast

      (The reverse of ‘**CRAP**’)
		</section>
		<section data-markdown class="crammed">
      # DESIGN: **02**

      **PROXIMITY** sets up *visual cues* that group similar items, suggesting how to ‘read’ content.

      - **Group complex content** for legibility
      - Display **related items** together
      - Use **common styles** to connect similar items

      Screenshots in the next slides are from older versions of the:

      - [Guardian website](https://www.theguardian.com/uk): “most viewed” news is **grouped** together, and there‘s a **common menu style** with varying **section colours**
      - [BBC iPlayer website](http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer): **proximity** and **style** group related items

		<section data-markdown>
			# DESIGN: **03**

			**ALIGNMENT** makes page elements seem **part of a whole**, creating a **holistic feel** to the various pieces of information.

			- Everything should be **placed thoughtfully** in the layout
			- Every item is **connected visually** with other page elements

			A strict use of **alignment** on a former version of the Oslo-based design agency Heydays website gives a pleasing sense of **coherence and simplicity**.

			**ALIGNMENT**: **grids** are the **primary method** for achieving **alignment**.

			**REPETITION** provides visual and cognitive **consistency** across common design elements

			- Repeat **design themes** throughout the interface
			- Consistent sizing and proportions strengthen **style**

			Use: global **style rules** at the **top** of your CSS **before `@media` query breakpoints** to *style elements consistently* e.g. **colours**, image **widths** (not height), matching **heading** styles…

			# DESIGN: **05**

			**CONTRAST**

			- Make **distinctly different** items *look* different
			- Contrast makes content appear **visually inviting**

			There are many ways to create contrast. For example:  
			**colour, fonts, rules, column widths**, etc.

			- Javascript plugin site [unheap.com](http://www.unheap.com/) uses **bold colours**
			- A previous design for agency [Touch](http://www.thetouchagency.co.uk/) used nice **hover transitions** (the current site is slow and annoying!)
